Feb 10th, 2016 : 

Most of you assholes already forgot about your new years resolutions. 

That's because you run on auto pilot. Everyone and everything is telling what to do and you forgot to shape your own reality. 

Let me take that back. 

YOU DO SHAPRE YOUR OWN REALITY. You just forgot you were doing it. So the reality you shaped is less like a painting you envisioned, and more like handing a kid buckets of paint and telling him to go nuts. You know shit's gonna go down...but you never know what. 

What does that mean for you?

I don't care really...

But I'd say it means that everything happening in your life is of your own design. So if it's GREAT...you did it. If it SUCKS...you did it.

I've gotten very heavy in to practicing LOA aggressively and it has paid of rapidly this year. Why? Because I make my life all about my goals and I take responsibility for ALL THE THINGS that happen. 

I suggest you try the same. 

If you have any questions, complaints, or shit you wanna brag about... email me from www.samcaban.com
