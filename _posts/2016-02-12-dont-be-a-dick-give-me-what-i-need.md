I PRETTY MUCH TEACH YOU THE LAW OF ATTRACTION **FOR FREE** HERE & AT [**SAM CABAN DOT COM**][0] ALL THE TIME. BUT IF YOU WANT, I'M CURRENTLY WRITING A BOOK THAT WILL SELL ON **[AMAZON][1]** CALLED "YOU SUCK AT THE LAW OF ATTRACTION".

I'M ALSO GOING TO MAKE **[UDEMY][2]** COURSES FOR CHEAP AS HELL AND JUST LIVE MY LIFE.

# THAT'S ALL

So anyways, I think my book is going to kick ass. Not because I think you'll buy it, but because I think people that are into LOA are always into the next NEW LOA thing.  What they don't know is that I'm only doing this to reach out to people that don't know about LOA. We're all trying to reach enlightenment. It's kind of hard to hit the next level as a human race if we talk about LOA like it's not common knowledge or constantly praise LOA celebrities like Abraham Hicks or Rhonda Byrne. 

I don't even want to be a GURU. Don't invite me to a seminar. DON'T ASK. You can send money, but I'm not coming. That's it. The point is that you need to see success for yourself. If I take more money than I need from a bunch of suckers, I know I'm not helping the world. But if I fill a need, which in this case is that LOA has to reach a NEW GENERATION of people, and I get paid fairly for it, I'm good to go. I can just sit back and enjoy all the fucking success stories from great students. The students become teachers. Is World Peace and a resource based economy a lofty goal?

I'm in my new home eating a pizza since it's my cheat day and I want to stay ripped so I can only have it on Sunday's.  I usually eat pizza in my four door, yellow Jeep Wrangler XL and drop sauce all over the seats. This time I'm inside. I'm watching my favorite video of myself kick someone's ass in a point fighting tournament. My trophy is also watching. He makes a great TV watching buddy. 

Bye for NOW!

Yup. :)
