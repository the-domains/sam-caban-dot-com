The LAW OF ATTRACTION WORKS EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT.

I was driving around today on the way to MMA class and lost track of where I was supposed to jump off the free way. I then decided that there was a good reason that it happened. 

As I was cruising around I could see myself getting a bit annoyed with drivers around me. I could feel tension as one asshole after the next started tailing me and I was responding to the shitty energy. I tried to visualize more positive things. 

At some point I simply decided that I needed to turn around and go home. I felt spent even though my day went very well. 

Red light.

I stop. 

A public bus cruises by with a sign saying, 
> 
> "Get what you want. Not what you don't want."

I remember that everything that's happening is only happening because I'm getting something I want. 

I come to realize that from all my busy work that I'm tired and aching. So I take a bath with epson salts in hot water, eliminating all the tension from my body. This tension is what has been blocking my ability to stay positive in the moment. 

## Somehow, my subconscious had brought me to a point of UNAVOIDABLE RELAXATION AND RELIEF. 

My throat had also been hoarse from yelling at students in workout bootcamps to keep them motivated. I had a small cup of ice cream to soothe my throat. I also took a nap. My day immediately improved. 

LOA is a constant living organism that responds to what you feel and how you think. If the world knows you are in need of rest, it will create a situation that will deliver you rest. If it sees you need money, it delivers. If it sees you need friends, it delivers.

Your job is to KNOW IT DELIVERS and have the BALLS to RECEIVE EVERY FREE GIFT IT GIVES. 

Can you at least do THAT?
